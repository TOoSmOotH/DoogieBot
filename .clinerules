- Insted of "docker-compose" we use "docker compose"
- All testing should be done in docker. We should not install any modules on the local system.
- We should never use docker volumes. We should bind mount to the local filesystem.
- everything should run in a single docker container.
- when changes are amde we should auto reload the frotnend and backend to see the new code.
- For API URL handling, always use the utilities in frontend/services/api.ts:
  - Regular API calls should use the standard API functions (get, post, put, del) which automatically include the '/api/v1' prefix
  - For special cases like EventSource that need direct access to the API, use the getApiUrl() function with useBaseUrl=false
  - Do not modify the Next.js proxy configuration without careful consideration
  - Never hardcode '/api/v1' in service files - let the api.ts utilities handle the prefixing
