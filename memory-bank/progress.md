# Project Progress

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Backend Development & Integration (Phase 2 & 4 In Progress)

The project has completed its initial setup phase and frontend development phase. We've also made significant progress on the backend development and integration phases. We have established the memory bank, defined the project requirements, created a detailed implementation plan, set up the basic project structure with Docker configuration, and implemented the frontend components including the chat interface, user profile management, and admin dashboard. We've now implemented chat functionality with LLM integration and connected the frontend to the backend API.

## What Works

- Memory bank structure has been created
- Project requirements have been documented
- System architecture has been defined
- Technical stack has been specified
- Detailed implementation plan has been developed
- Basic project structure has been created
- Docker and Docker Compose configuration has been set up
- Git repository has been initialized
- Backend structure with FastAPI has been set up
- Database models and migrations have been configured
- Frontend structure with Next.js has been set up
- Frontend authentication flow has been implemented
- Chat interface with streaming support has been created
- User profile management has been developed
- Admin dashboard has been built
- Dark/light mode theming has been implemented
- Chat management functionality in the backend
- API endpoints for chat functionality including streaming responses
- LLM service integration for chat responses
- Frontend-backend connection for chat functionality
- Streaming response handling for real-time chat interactions
- Consistent API URL handling across the frontend

## Known Issues

1. **User Management**
   - âœ… Fixed: Users not being listed in the admin interface
   - âœ… Fixed: Pending users not showing up in the admin interface
   - âœ… Fixed: Improved error messages for pending user login attempts
   - âœ… Fixed: Registration flow now provides clear feedback to users
   - âœ… Fixed: Admin access properly working after user model alignment
   - âœ… Fixed: Specific error message for pending users during login
   - âœ… Fixed: API error handling to properly extract FastAPI error details

2. **Frontend-Backend Communication**
   - âœ… Fixed: Error handling in API service to properly extract error details from FastAPI responses
   - âœ… Fixed: Error message display for better user experience
   - âœ… Fixed: API routing issues by updating URL prefixes in Next.js configuration
   - âœ… Fixed: Frontend API service to use the correct API URL prefix
   - âœ… Fixed: Implemented consistent approach for API URL handling across the frontend

3. **Chat Functionality**
   - âœ… Fixed: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')" errors by adding null checks
   - âœ… Fixed: Added defensive coding to handle undefined values throughout the chat page
   - âœ… Fixed: Updated the chat loading logic to properly initialize empty arrays
   - âœ… Fixed: Chat creation process to handle undefined state
   - âœ… Fixed: Proper error handling for streaming responses
   - âœ… Fixed: SQLite IntegrityError with updated_at field by explicitly setting the timestamp
   - âœ… Fixed: API routing by setting the correct baseURL in the API service to '/api/v1'
   - âœ… Fixed: EventSource URL to use the correct path without the '/api/v1' prefix
   - âœ… Fixed: Next.js proxy configuration to correctly route API requests to the backend
   - âœ… Added: Rule in .clinerules about not modifying the Next.js proxy configuration and using '/api/v1' as the baseURL
   - âœ… Fixed: Implemented unified approach for API URL handling with utility functions
   - âœ… Fixed: Chat interface scrolling issues with proper container layout and scroll behavior
